Another IRC bot.


Directory Structure
-------------------

bruh/       Contains any core files for the bot, (there should be barely any).
data/       Data directory used by plugins/database.py.
plugins/    Self-explanatory.


General Info and Shit
---------------------

The bot does as little as possible, basically the bot does nothing but loop
through incoming IRC messages, and pass them onto event handlers. Event
handlers do everything else; PING messages for example are handled by a plugin.


Writing Plugins
